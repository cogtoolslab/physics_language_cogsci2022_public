Secondly, consider the weights of the balls, and which colour corresponds to each weight - this will change how far they travel in the direction of the arrow before travelling down due to gravity. Thirdly, consider the wind direction, there is wind outside but not inside. Use trial and error to figure out the direction of the wind.",pedagogy

The background that looks like its inside has regular gravity and draws the balls to the centre of the floor. As for the balls, the pink one has the most force, the blue one has medium force, and the brown ball has very little force behind it.

The arrow direction is pretty accurate for the brown ball and it moves with more impact so just put the paddle across from the arrow.

For example, if the ball is launched from the top of the circle, gravity will cause it to go almost directly straight down. However, if the ball is launched from the side it will follow a parabolic path due to the effects of gravity and direction of launching.

Think of each ball of having a certain weight, one is heavy, one is light, and the other is a medium weight. Then match this up with the room. Each room essentially has ""wind"" that blows the balls in a direction, factor this in along with the weight and you should have a somewhat decent chance of catching the ball.",pedagogy

Then suddenly it will change elsewhere.\nThe power of the ball moving will change randomly too. So you never know if its going straight or left or right or back to where it came from.\nGood Luck,pedagogy

The blue ball acts as if a toddler is throwing it - little power behind each throw and the red and yellow arrows don\'t differ in power as much. The brown and green balls act more accurately to the arrows, red being striking directly in the direction give or taking a few steps left and right (depending on where it was first placed.

The background of the game determines the trajectory. The indoor room is similar to any indoor area-no wind, and the laws of gravity are the same. The tropical background causes the balls\' trajectory to be swayed- almost like there is a wind being blown southeast. The color of the arrow determines how hard the ball is being thrown. Yellow is a throw with less force and red is a throw with more force. All of these factors are to be considered when determining where to place the paddle. For example, if blue ball is being thrown straight up in the indoor room with the yellow arrow, it is a good estimate to place the paddle directly above the arrow at the top of the circle. The lighter amount of force is likely enough for the ball to reach the top. However, if the brow or pink ball was being thrown in the same room with the same amount if force, it would be a good estimate to place the paddle directly below the throwing position because there is not enough force to get the heavier balls to the top of the circle. If the blue ball was being thrown in the tropical background with the red arrow from the bottom of the circle, it would be a good estimate to place the paddle in the top right area of the circle.

The most important thing to remember is that the gravity in each location is different, the ""floor"" being on different parts of the sphere. In the indoor room location, the floor is dead center at the bottom of the sphere, so if you throw a ball down from the top of the sphere in the center, it will drop straight down no matter what. If it is thrown from the bottom, the heavier balls will just throw up a bit, then fall straight back down, but if the pink ball is thrown with a lot of force it will reach the ""roof"". In the outdoor location, it\'s more tricky. The ""floor"" of the sphere seems to be on the bottom right. So if a ball is thrown from dead center on the bottom of the sphere, it will actually curve to the right. I found it hard to pinpoint the location, and it almost felt like gravity was a little lower there, but I could be wrong.
